# Flex Containers and Flex Items

To use Flexbox, you need a container set to `display: flex;`.

By default, a flex container goes all the way across the screen, like a block level element.

You can also set it to `display:inline-flex;`, like an inline element, and it will wrap around the content and only take up the width that the content needs.

The immediate children of a flexbox container automatically become flex items.
